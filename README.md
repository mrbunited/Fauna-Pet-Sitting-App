# Fauna-Pet-Sitting-App

'Fauna' Pet-Sitting App

Project Team: Maryia, Rigo, Ulas, Andrei

==========================================================================================================================

The Problem:

Fauna is a web-appliction designed for the purpose of connecting pet owners with pet sitters. While it seems as
if there are already several applications that address this need (like Rover and Fetch) these particular applications
are lacking in a very key area.  These applcations assume that everyday people only need pet care services for their
dogs or cats.  There is an entire population of animal owners that are everyday people living in cities around the
country that have rabbits, ferrets, parrots, boa constrictors, turtles, fish tanks, tarantulas and iguanas.  
Yet, there is no easy to use app to locate passionate, caring, and reliable people in their cities that are willing 
to provide services to students and professionals who need to travel and cannot take their companions along.  
That is where Fauna comes in.

"Fauna" literally means the animals of a particular region, habitat, or geological period.  Fauna 'the app' strives to
connect pet owners with a pet-sitter with the knowledge, experience, and facilities to provide care for pet parents of
a wide variety. 

==========================================================================================================================

How the App Works:

Pet owners and pet-sitters alike register to join fauna. Registration is free. For a pet owner to register, they fill
out a profile with their name, location, contact information, emergency veterinary contact, list for all of the 
animals in their household, and special care instructions.

Pet sitters register with their profile information, contact information, daily rates, areas of expertise, 
and any notable credentials or licensures.

When a registerd pet owner signs onto fauna, they have a simplified interface similar to other applications they have
grown familiar with (such as Uber).  The pet owner enters their advanced dates and which of their registered pets
require care.  All available pet sitters pop up on a map interface and clicking on their profile opens up their pet
sitter profile with reviews and a scheduling tool. From there a pet owner is able to schedule a date for service.  
In the pet owners account,their upcoming booked appointments are listed, and they may cancel in advance.

Technologies: This app will be a SPA (single page application) and utilize React on the front-end along with 
a styling CDN (Bootstrap or another). We will utilize MongoDB as our database technology, and Express along with Node
to manage the back-end. We will also utilize Google Maps API.

MVP: Project version - 
-- We will build a user homepage.
-- We will create a Mongo databse of mock pet owners and pet-sitters.  
-- We will have a search for sitters page with the google maps pins of pet sitters.
-- We will be able to click on a pet sitter and open up their profile 
page complete with scheduling tool.
-- We will be able to schedule a date and time for pet sitting.
-- We will be able to return to the user home page and see upcoming 
dates for pet sitting.
-- For demo purposes we will see the pet-sitter and pet owner APIs

Version 2.0: We will include the pet-sitter login view. We will include a payment set up
feature. We will include a 0-5 star review system.
